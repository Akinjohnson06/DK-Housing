# Housing Project 
## Descriptive and Predictive analysis

## Overview
This project involves data analysis and data science techniques to explore, model, and draw insights from housing-related data. The goal is to uncover trends, make predictions, and present findings that can inform decision-making in real estate, urban planning, or related domains.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:** Handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in housing datasets.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualize key trends and relationships in the data.
- **Predictive Modeling:** Use machine learning techniques to predict housing prices or other relevant metrics.
- **Interactive Visualizations:** Dashboards and plots to communicate findings effectively.
